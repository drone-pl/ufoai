	AI moduel methods, these work on the currently moving AI actor (Unless noted otherwise parameters are optional):

				"phalanx":	Single player player's team
				"civilian":	Self explanatory
				"alien":	Self explanatory
				Note: Prefixing the team name with '-' or '~' will inverse the team rules (means: members *not* from the given team), *do not* use with "all"
			sort_order -- Order to sort the result in (ascending order):
				"dist":		Linear distance to seen actor (default)
				"path":		Pathing distance to seen actor.
				"HP":		HP of the seen actor.

		crouch (state) -- Check if the AI actor is crouching (returns a boolean value) and optionally change stance.
			state -- Ask the AI actor to asume an specific stance:
				true:		Crouch.
				false:		Stand.

		reactionfire (state) -- Check if Reaction Fire is enabled (returns a boolean value) and optionally change it
			state -- Ask to change the RF state:
				"disable":	Disable reaction fire.

		grabweapon () -- Try to get a working weapon from the AI actor's inventory or the floor (to the right hand)

		findweapons (full_search) -- Returns a table of the positions (userdatas) of nearby usable weapons on the floor
			full_search -- If true include unreachable weapons

		roundsleft () -- Return the number rounds left in each hand's weapon (two values, for right and lef hand respectively) or nil if the weapon is unloaded (zero is returned only for weapons that _don't_ need any ammo)

		canreload () -- Check if weapons can be reloaded (returns two boolean values -- right and left hand)

		reload (hand) -- Try to reload a weapon
			hand -- Which hand's weapon to reload, valid values: "right" (default) and "left"

			target -- *Required* Actor (userdata) to shoot at.
			position_type -- Strategy to find the shooting position:
				"fastest":	(Default) Less pathing cost to get to.
				"nearest":	Closest to the target.
				"farthest":	Farhest from the target.
			tus -- max number of TUs to use for moving + shooting (defaults to use all tus).

		postionhide (team) -- Returns a position (pos3 userdata) for the AI actor to hide in or false if none found.
			team -- Team to hide from, vlaid values: "phalanx", "civilian" and "alien", defaults to "alien" if AI is civilian and "all but our own team" (not a valid value) otherwise.

		positionherd (target) -- Returns a position (pos3 userdata) from where target can be used as a meatshield or false if none found.
			target -- *Required* Actor (userdata) to hide behind.

			vision -- What to see with. Like for see() but only accepts "all" (default), "sight" and "extra"
			team -- Which team mission targets to get. Accepts same values as see() (defaults to "all")
			sort_order -- In which order to sort the targets. LIke for see() but only allows "dist" (default) and "path"

		positionmission (position) -- Returns a position in the area of the given target position, it is meant to have the AI deend mission targets or move to waypoints without all AI actors trying to move into the exact same position.
			position -- Position (pos3 userdata) to move close to.

		waypoints (distance, sort_order) -- Return a table of positions (userdatas) of the next waypoints for the current AI actor (Note: currently only civilian waypoints exist)
			distance -- Waypoints closer than this won't be considered (maptiles)
			sort_order -- Order to sort the waypoints in. Same as see() but only "dist" (default) and "path" are available

		setwaypoint (position) -- Sets the current AI actor waypoint
			position -- Position of the waypoint to set as current, if omited clear the current waypoint (to restart the search)

		positionwander (strategy, origin, radius) -- Returns a position (userdata) to wander to within the given area.
			strategy -- Which strategy to use for wandering.
				"rand":		Choose a random position within the given area (default)
				"CW": 		Try to move on a clockwise circle around the given area
				"CCW":		Try to move counter-clockwise around the given area.
			origin -- Center of the area to wander about, defaults to current actor position.
			radius -- Radius -in maptiles- of the area to wander about, defaults to current actor TUs / 2

		positionflee () -- Returns a position (userdata) where to flee.

		difficulty () -- Returns the current difficulty of the batlescape from -4 (easiest) to 4 (hardest)

		actor () -- Returns the currently mocving AI actor (userdata)

			actor -- Actor to shoot at.
			tus -- Max TUs to use for shooting (defaults to using all available TUs)

		throwgrenade (actor, min_group, tus) -- Makes the current AI actor try to throw a grenade at the given actor, returns true if a grenade was thrown.
			actor -- Actor to throw at.
			min_group -- Min number of actors that must be within the grenades splash radius to throw the grenade (defaults to zero)
			tus -- Max TUs to use for shooting (defaults to using all available TUs)

		distance (position, type) -- Returns the distance to the given position.
			type -- "dist" (default -- linear distance in map units) or "path" (pathing distance)
